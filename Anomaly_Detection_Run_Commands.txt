# Commands to Run the Real-Time Anomaly Detection Code

## Step 1: Install the Required Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install TensorFlow, Streamlit, Plotly, and other necessary dependencies.

## Step 2: Run the Streamlit Application
To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
streamlit run anomaly_detection.py
```



## Step 3: Interact via the Browser
Once the application starts, Streamlit will open a new tab in your web browser where you can interact with the anomaly detection system. If it does not open automatically, you can manually open your browser and navigate to the following address:

```bash
http://localhost:8501
```
